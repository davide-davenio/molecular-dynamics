# molecular-dynamics
Molecular dynamics code in MatLab created for a course project. 

Main simulation code is MolecularDynamics.m, while Minimization.m is a kinetik
steepest descent implementation to be used on initial configuations if periodic 
boundary conditions are not present.

Subroutines folder contains all secondary functions, with some being unused in 
the final version of the simulation code but still present in some of the 
analysis scripts.
